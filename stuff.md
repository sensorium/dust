This piece responds to the Museum's collection and the theme of "Time" set by the Museum.  

Shipâ€™s bells marked time for crew shifts in a finite, shared environment.  Eight bells, rung at the end of a watch, were also rung as an obituary marking the end of a life.

In the alarm phase of this piece, nine bells ring.  The surplus strike gestures to a world facing crises in both natural and human systems. The finality of "eight bells" eludes us; we are not "finished" yet, but time is pressing.  

The alarm phase then falls apart, tinkling like the rigging of luxury yachts at a port marina.  Are we too easily distracted to respond when it counts?

Imagine the length of this pipe as the duration that First Nations people have lived here.  The last centuries of settlement would be about as long as the thread at the pipe's end.

Hot, angry clowns, this is no way to cool down! No Export Quality Solution! We endanger the very ecosystems of which we are part.

These car exhaust mufflers are being used to "ring the changes", a bell-ringing term which means to go through the possibilities of a limited set of resources.  The sequences regenerate and evolve by recombining waste management data for NSW from the Environmental Protection Agency.  The work is a call to wake up, acknowledge the limits of old ideas, and articulate new combinations and possibilities present in our situation.
